\title{Yule's Q}
\usage{
qYule(OR)
}
\arguments{
\item{OR}{A vector or a symmetric matrix of odds ratios.}
}
\value{
A vector or a matrix with Q coefficients computed from the OR.
Values of Q can vary between -1 and 1.
âˆ’1 reflects total negative association,
+1 reflects perfect positive association,
and 0 reflects no association.
}
\description{
Compute the Yule coefficient of association.
}
\details{
The coefficient is computed as
Q = (OR-1)/(OR+1),
where OR is the odds ratio.
}
\examples{

# single value
qYule(1.5)

# matrix of odds ratios
OR <- matrix(c(1, 3.5, 0.1,
               3.5, 1, 1.3,
               0.1, 1.3, 1), ncol=3)
